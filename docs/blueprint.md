- Background color: Off-White (#F0F8F4), a very desaturated tint of green to provide a clean and calming backdrop.
- Accent color: Forest Green (#228B22), a darker analogous shade of green, with moderately different brightness and saturation than the primary color to highlight key actions.

- Headline font: 'PT Sans', same as body.
- Consistent use of outline-style icons from a library like FontAwesome or Material Icons, focusing on clarity and learnability.
- A clean and modular layout with clear sections for navigation, content display, and user interaction.
